          Youtubers and marketing make us believe that if we read all the
          ‘must-read’ self-help books they recommend, we will be leading the
          future. And if we don’t read them, we will be worthless in the future.
          <br /><br />
          Is it? This belief needs to be challenged.
        </p>

        <p class="TE-content">
          <br />
          This belief has forced us to corrupt the true process of reading. We
          see books as a tool for self-growth and learning. However, the way
          many people read books growth is nowhere in sight.
          <br /><br />
          While they crave ‘learning’, they are sold to the idea of ‘reading’.
        </p>

        <p class="TE-content">
          <br />
          Let’s see some common reading patterns. In fear of missing out on the
          future, they include all the recommended books in their reading list.
          The list is long. To read faster, they keep goals like reading 20
          pages a day or completing a book in a week. While reading one book
          they’re only seconds away from thinking of another book in the list
          they could read.
        </p>
        <br />
        <i class="font_size_17"> What’s really happening here? </i>

        <br />
        <br />
        <p class="TE-content">
          They keep reading book after book and feel satisfied as they jam their
          shelf with all the ‘best sellers’. They take pride in the number of
          books they have read. They believe that they are growing and learning
          with each book. However, back on earth, these are nothing more than a
          few feelings.
        </p>
        <p class="TE-content">
          <br />
          In reality, they are only reading for numbers and bragging. Only to
          move the book from reading list to read list.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>

        <i class="font_size_17"
          >Where’s the ‘learnings’ and ‘growth’ they were looking for?</i
        >
        <br /><br />
        <p class="TE-content">
          The soul of a book is in its pages. Quickly finishing a book won’t
          give us the growth we are looking for. The learning we aim for happens
          when we stay with the words and sentences of a book.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p class="TE-content">
          Read a paragraph. Sit with it for some time. Try to understand the
          author’s point of view.
          <br /><br />
          As you get an ‘ah-ha’ moment, take a pause and question, what’s
          different in this idea? Is it really insightful? How can I apply it in
          my current situation?
        </p>

        <p class="TE-content">
          <br />
          The hype is around visiting as many best and must-read as possible.
          Rethink the way you explore books. The big shelf is for bragging.
          Learning is on the pages.
        </p>
