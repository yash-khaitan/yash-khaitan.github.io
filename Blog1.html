            <p>
              Because we all faced problems in solving Math sums which requires
              logical thinking, we assume it is "logical thinking" only that
              makes this subject tough. In reality, it has a  crime partner. He
              always sneaks out under bushes and never gets caught, just like
              every real life criminals. His name is "Infinite syllabus". The
              Syllabus for Math is infinite. Here's how
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              In class 12, for example, sums can be asked from topics of class
              9th, 10th or 11th. Even though  these topics are not part of 12th
              syllabus. sums, for example, can be asked based on "circles",
              which you studied in 10th, though it was not part of your 12th
              syllabus. And the argument supporting this crime partner is-
              <i
                >Oh! you studied these in class 10 so you should remember it in
                class 12. Yah! I did study it in 10th but now I have grown up
                and am in class 12th, why don't you grow up?</i
              >
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              Now comes the tricky part. You won't face this partner in other
              subjects. In English, you will never be asked, "why Bassanio
              borrowed money from Ferdinand and went on to marry Miranda?"<sup
                ><a href="#Footnote1">[1]</a></sup
              >
              (Though Shakespeare could argue what's there in the name but we
              won't buy that). The point is it's only Math who had nurtured this
              criminal.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              Finally In Math exams. The sums are tough. The syllabus is
              infinite. And you forgot your calculator. Best combinations.
